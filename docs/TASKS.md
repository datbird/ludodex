# ludodex — task queue

The working backlog. Numbers are stable task IDs referenced in commit messages
(`feat(match-confidence): … (#13)`). Per-task design docs live in
`docs/superpowers/specs/`; execution plans in `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

## Top of queue

- **Cover / hero loading spinner** (do first). While a cover or hero image is loading —
  especially when there's a fetch delay — show a small spinning loading indicator instead of
  a blank/black area, so it reads as "still loading" rather than "loaded empty". Applies to
  the library grid covers, the detail hero, and anywhere an image is fetched on demand.

## Open

Nothing is open pending code. One item is **data-gated**:

| # | Task | What's left |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | Auto-fix confidence tuning | The gate is now a setting (Settings → Library → "Automatic fixes"), defaulting to 75. Choosing a *different* value needs a real library to observe false positives against — and it may well never need changing. |

The one-way **"Publish catalog"** mirror was **retired** 2026-07-21: nothing ever read what
it published, and its name was persistently confused with the backing store that actually
protects your data (that confusion *was* task #16). Its PocketBase/Firestore primitives were
extracted to `remote_db.py`, which `dbsync.py` is built on.

#2 is **closed**: all four backing-store backends now pass a live two-way round-trip
(`test_dbsync_live.py`). The only path still unexercised is Google's OAuth token mint
(`sync.fb_token`) against a real Firebase project — the emulator ignores auth. That code is
shared with the long-standing one-way Firestore mirror.

Task IDs 1 and 7 are not recorded in any surviving note — treat those numbers as retired
rather than assuming there is missing work behind them.

## Rebuild-dependent

These shipped but only take effect on the next full catalog build (`build_library`, via the
Server-ops → Rebuild button or a scan). On a freshly-wiped install they stay at zero until
the first sync + build:

- Match-confidence rule-based baseline across all identified entries (#13)
- CD32 re-key (#5)
- Fuzzy-match scrub results (#9)

## Backing-store testing

- `remote_db.py` holds the shared PocketBase/Firestore plumbing (ex-`sync.py`).
- `test_dbsync_firestore.py` — offline, no creds, no container. Fake Firestore REST server.
- `test_dbsync_live.py <backend>` — real two-way round-trip (push, no-op re-sync, pull,
  delete both ways, convergence) against an isolated `LUDODEX_DATA`. Run it inside the
  container, where the psycopg/PyMySQL drivers live:
  `docker exec -e LUDODEX_DATA=/tmp/dbsync-live ludodex python3 /app/test_dbsync_live.py postgres`
- For Firestore without a Google project, run a Firestore emulator and set
  `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=<host:port>` (also settable as config `firestore_emulator_host`).
  The adapter skips service-account token minting in that mode.

## Guards

- `web/scripts/hooksweep.mjs` runs inside `pnpm build`: a React hook after an early return
  (or in a conditional/loop/callback) fails the build. It exists because oxlint has no
  `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` rule and this repo has no eslint, so nothing caught the
  white-screen bug of `17be9ce`. Run it alone with `pnpm lint:hooks`.
- Error boundaries wrap the app root and each settings panel, so a render error degrades to
  a recoverable inline message rather than a blank page.

## Parked / blocked

- **ScreenScraper** — code complete, blocked on a forum devid/devpassword. See `DESIGN.md` §11.
- **Nintendo source** — PKCE login verified and UI-wired; `fetch_owned()` is still a TODO.
- **Device layer v1** (push-only) — designed in `DESIGN.md`, not built.
- **Discover / want-vs-have capstone** — store sale-watching over the wanted list. Wishlist
  import (Steam, GOG) and the Wanted attribute exist; the universe browser and price watching
  do not.
- **Art importers for Epic / EA / GOG / itch** — provider art-type → kind maps are researched
  and in place, but no fetch module exists; those stores are ownership-only today.
- **Magic-animations research** — evaluate a reference site's scroll animations for possible UI
  use. Discussion first, nothing started.

## UI tweaks

- **Match-confidence pill placement** — the `◎ NN% match` pill currently renders in the
  detail **About** header (`web/src/App.tsx` ~5405, `AboutSection`). Remove it from there;
  keep the confidence indicator **only** in the "View / edit all attributes" section. (Raised
  during wand testing 2026-07-23.)

- **Header stats line miscalculates** (bug) — the dashboard/library header reads
  "`N identified games · M with art · X cross-source`" and the numbers are wrong: observed
  **2,067 with art vs 1,506 identified** (with-art can't exceed identified) and
  **0 cross-source** (should be >0 for games owned on >1 source). Audit the stats query —
  "with art" is likely counting media-index norm_keys (incl. wanted/unidentified, or
  per-entry rows) rather than identified games with a chosen cover; cross-source count looks
  broken. (Raised 2026-07-23.)

- **Library toolbar → single line** (redesign). Today it's two rows (top: Basic/AI/Query,
  Owned/Wanted/All, Filters, Sort; bottom: results count + Per-page, Posters/Table, Columns,
  Select, Tools, Add game). Collapse to one line:
  1. **Basic/AI/Query = an expandable half-pill on the RIGHT edge of the search field.**
     Collapsed it shows only the current mode. Tap → it smoothly expands leftward *within the
     search field's own horizontal footprint* to reveal the three options; pick one → it
     collapses back to just the chosen label, sized to that text. (Search-mode selector,
     currently the left segmented control.)
  2. **Owned / Wanted / All → move into the Filters popover**, keeping its current segmented
     form, placed at the TOP of the filter panel — above the "Search attributes" field and
     the include/exclude attribute list.
  3. **New "View" button after Filters** that contains: Posters/Table toggle, Sort, Columns,
     and the Per-page selector (all four currently loose on the toolbar).
  4. **Left-justified:** Filters, View. **Right-justified:** Select, Tools, Add game. Those
     three are the only other top-level buttons.
  (Raised 2026-07-23. `web/src/App.tsx` library toolbar ~line 1000+.)

## Open design decision

- **Selection policy** (`DESIGN.md` §9) — which games push to a device: allowlist / tag /
  platform / all-playable. Gates the device-layer push UX, not the server.

## Doc hygiene

`HANDOFF.md` predates the server build and still describes the AI-forward server as the one
open task. It needs a rewrite (or retirement in favour of `DESIGN.md` + this file) before it
misleads anyone picking the project up.
